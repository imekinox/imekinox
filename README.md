### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Juan Carlos, CTO at [joinentre](https://joinentre.com/)! 

I'm passionate about engineering, software, and technology, and I'm driven by the desire to create innovative solutions for today's challenges. With a strong background in Javascript, React, and AWS, I love to immerse myself in the world of coding and problem-solving.

As a developer and entrepreneur, I'm always eager to meet new people, build teams, and hire top talent. I believe that collaboration is key to success, and I'm constantly looking for opportunities to learn from others and grow both personally and professionally.

If you're interested in finding a mentor or coach, I'd be more than happy to share my experiences and knowledge. My goal is to empower others to achieve their dreams and make a lasting impact in the tech industry. So, let's connect, collaborate, and change the world together!
